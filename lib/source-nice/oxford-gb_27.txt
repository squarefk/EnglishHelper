	NOTE ON USAGE 用法
	**In British English quite can have different meanings partly depending on the intonation of the sentence. 在英式英语中, quite 一词有时靠句中的语调可表达不同的意思. 
	1 If quite carries the main stress when used with gradable words (ie those describing qualities which can be of different strengths or degrees) it has a negative meaning such as `not very' 若quite有主要重音, 与之连用的是表示程度的词（即其性质可有强弱或程度差别者）, 则quite有否定含义, 如｀不很＇
	**He's `quite handsome. 他不太漂亮.
	**  She played `quite well. 她表演得不怎么好. 
	2 If quite receives secondary or no stress the sentence expresses more approval and possibly surprise 如quite有次重音或无重音, 则全句较具褒义, 也可能表示惊奇
	**I was quite `pleased. 我挺高兴.
	**  I think he's quite `handsome. 我认为他够漂亮的了. 
	3 When quite is used with aword expressing an absolute quality, it means `completely' and does not usually carry the main stress 若quite与表示绝对的词连用时, 其意为｀完全＇, 通常不带主要重音
	**It was quite `wonderful. 那可太妙了.
	**  She played quite `brilliantly. 她表演得优美极了. But compare 试比较 I ,quite a`gree with you (= I entirely agree with you). 我完全同意你的意见.
