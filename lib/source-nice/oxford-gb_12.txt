	NOTE ON USAGE 用法
	**The adverbs fairly, quite, rather and pretty can all mean `moderately', `to some extent' or `not very' and are used to alter the strength of adjectives and adverbs. *fairly、quite、rather、pretty这几个副词均可表示｀适度地＇、｀在某种程度上＇或｀不很＇的意思, 常用以改变所修饰的形容词或副词的分量. Fairly is the weakest and pretty the strongest and most informal, but their effect is very much influenced by intonation. *fairly词义最弱而pretty词义最强, 也最通俗, 但词义的强弱受语调的影响很大. Generally, the more any of these adverbs is stressed, the more negative the sentence sounds. 一般说来, 这类副词读得越重, 句子听起来否定含义就越强.

	**The house is rather bigger than we thought. 这所房子比我们想的大得多.
	**  These shoes are rather too small. 这双鞋未免太小了. 
	4 Rather and quite can precede the indefinite article when followed by an adjective + noun *rather和quite与｀不定冠词+形容词+名词＇连用时, 可置于不定冠词之前

	**  a rather/quite/fairly/pretty nice day 十分晴朗的一天. See also note on usage at quite 另见所附用法.
